                            It's honestly really frustrating to learn JavaScript programming! I was constantly beset by confusion and things not working. But that's actually the norm and accepting that it's going to be frustrating made it easier for me to keep going and not give up due to Impostor Syndrome.

                            Finding quality instructors who felt like they were approachable and did overuse gatekeeping language (e.g. "easy", "simple" when it doesn't feel easy or simple as a beginner) was instrumental for me. Treasure Porth really helped me so much with getting started and like I could do this.

                            It felt like a big gap between what I learned from Treasure Porth's introductory classes to the next level of making a working app of my own idea, and I spent a lot of time with topical tutorials on the web. I was looking for help with breaking down my idea into pieces of an app. Eventually my frustration with those lead me to this exceptional and professional educator.

                            This is the course I took, which I've followed linearly for parts and skipped around to try things out in actual practice apps. Source code is available on Github for all the projects built in the course.
